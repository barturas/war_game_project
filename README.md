1.3.3 part - War game pair programming project


I. The program will play the game with itself.

Actions
  1. Get a new deck of cards (52).
  2. Shuffle the deck.
  3. Split the shuffled deck into two piles (player 1 and player 2)
  4. Print statuses after each action.
  5. After prompt "Start the game?" the user should initiate or exit the war game by inputting 'start' or 'exit' respectively.
  6. Once started the game should be played in the background (quickly) and game stats should be printed, e.g., Player 1 won the game after x rounds and y wars.


II. The weight of cards

In this project the Ace will have maximum weight (power) - 14, then the king - 13 and so on until 2. 

Deck class should output a list of 52 cards with the format: 14_H, 13_H ... 3_S, 2_S
